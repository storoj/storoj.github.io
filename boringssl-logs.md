# [boringssl] Failed to log metrics

I guess every iOS developer must have experienced that issue. Every app that works with https receives these mysterious log messages from `boringssl`:
```
[boringssl] boringssl_metrics_log_metric_block_invoke(151) Failed to log metrics
```

It needs just a one-liner to reproduce the issue:
```
URLSession.shared
  .dataTask(with: URL(string: "https://google.com")!)
  .resume()
```

Stack Overflow, Apple Developer Forum, and others recommend to set `OS_ACTIVITY_MODE=disable`, but it makes things even worse. It silences `boringssl` as well as all your `NSLog`s.

```
// OS_ACTIVITY_MODE=disable

URLSession.shared
  .dataTask(with: URL(string: "https://google.com")!)
  .resume()
NSLog("hello")

// both boringssl and NSLog are silent
```

Let's find where do these logs come from.
```
(lldb) image lookup -r -s "boringssl"

`libboringssl.dylib` sounds promising. I opened it in Hopper Disassembler to find the string constant with the error message, and its usages.

"References To..." pointed to `boringssl_metrics_log_event` function. I am not an expert in assembly, so I switched Hopper to "Pseudo Code Mode" to see the function as plain C code.

It looked like this:
```
int boringssl_metrics_log_event(...) {
  // ...
  if (g_boringssl_log != NULL
      && os_log_type_enabled(g_boringssl_log, OS_LOG_TYPE_ERROR))
  {
    os_log_with_type(
      g_boringssl_log, 
      OS_LOG_TYPE_ERROR, 
      "%s(%d) Failed to log metrics",
      "boringssl_metrics_log_metric_block_invoke",
      0x12
    )
  }
  // ...
}
```

It seems like we could disable all the output by zeroing the value of `g_boringssl_log`. I stopped the running sample app on a breakpoint to check the availability of that variable:
```
(lldb) p g_boringssl_log
(OS_os_log *) $2 = 0x0000600000ac9d80
```

I was surprised to see that the variable is accessible by its name in lldb. Anyways, I changed its value to NULL:
```
(lldb) p g_boringssl_log = 0
(void *) $3 = 0x0000000000000000
```
... and made sure that all the boringssl logs disappeared.

Now I had to find a way to auto-reset the value of that variable on every app launch. That could possibly be achieved without even adding any code to the app â€“ by using breakpoints with actions. I thought I could add a breakpoint that calls `p g_boringssl_log = 0` and check `Automatically continue after evaluating actions`.

However, it did not seem to be possible to add such a breakpoint. The thing is that `libboringssl.dylib` is being loaded dynamically (lazily). That fact makes it impossible to just set a breakpoint on the app's startup function like `main` or `UIApplicationMain` because `boringssl` is not yet loaded, and `g_boringssl_log` is not yet initialized.

So I decided to find the code that initializes `g_boringssl_log`.

I opened the Terminal and ran `lldb` separately from Xcode:
```
% lldb

(lldb) breakpoint set -r '.' -s 'libboringssl.dylib'
Breakpoint 1: no locations (pending).

(lldb) process attach -n '$EXECUTABLE_NAME' -w

# lldb must attach and break

```

Now we know that `g_boringssl_log` gets initialized in `__boringssl_log_open_block_invoke`.

Switch back to Hopper Disassembler to find that function and its usages:
```
void boringssl_log_open() {
  static dispatch_once_t onceToken;

  dispatch_once(&onceToken, __boringssl_log_open_block_invoke);

  // with block contents inlined:
  dispatch_once(&onceToken, ^{
    g_boringssl_log = os_log_create("com.apple.network", "boringssl");
  });
}
```

The best idea so far was to `thread return` on `__boringssl_log_open_block_invoke`'s entry. So the body of that function will never be executed, and `g_boringssl_log` will not be initialized.

`boringssl` is not the only bully. There's also `libnetwork.dylib` that spams with `[connection] ... [...] Client called nw_connection_copy_connected_path on unconnected nw_connection` messages.

These logs could also be silenced by adding a similar breakpoint with `thread return` to `____nwlog_connection_log_block_invoke` from `libnetwork.dylib`.
